# LearningProject
Find a project to learn Dagger2 RxJava2 and some common android tech. I just find a open source to practice for using the tech in refactor our project. It just for myself learning, not for others. So, just take easy.

The project will be totally same with GeekNews. What I felt so sorry is I just copy it and understand the coding way deeply.
